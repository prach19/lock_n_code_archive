    <p id="desc">
      Therapi is a password-protected diary with a minimalist interface where
      users are able to process their feelings and emotions. We plan to include
      3 different journal templates for users to choose from. Firstly, we have a
      blank page template where the user has the freedom to write whatever they
      want. Secondly, we want to have a “quick journal” page that lets the user
      fill in the ‘highs’ and ‘lows’ of their day and what they’re looking
      forward to. Lastly, we would like to implement a “prompt” template where
      the user is given a random prompt and writes about it. Once the user is
      done, they can lock the diary and access their entries later with the
      right password.
